This is the train scheduling apoplication.  In all honesty, I spent a lot of time working on the rock paper scissor app, but I wasn't happy with the way it was performing and I ran out of time to do a re-write, so instead I put this one together.

I added a one minute update of the times.  I also had a method in there to the do the update by re-grabbing the data, but I decided that getting the data again was unnecessary.  I left that in the code, but commented out.
